* Partial application decorator
** TODO Look into preserving more function metadata
   Investigate how the @decorator decorator preserves original function
   metadata so that e.g. inspect.getargspec() still returns the original
   result.
* Composition mechanism
** TODO Figure out argspecs for composite functions
   How should we handle argument specifications for composite, partially
   applicable functions?  Should we just attempt to evaluate on the very
   first invocation?
* Unit tests
** TODO Test composition of methods
** TODO Find non-setuptools test execution solution
* Documentation
** TODO What's the Pythonic way to present full module documentation?
** TODO Add examples to README.md
