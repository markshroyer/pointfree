* Supporting multiple Python versions
** Python 2
*** DONE Test in Python 2.6
    CLOSED: [2011-11-04 Fri 20:02]
** Python 3
*** DONE Test in Python 3.0
    CLOSED: [2011-11-06 Sun 01:14]
*** DONE Test in Python 3.1
    CLOSED: [2011-11-06 Sun 00:48]
*** DONE Test in Python 3.2
    CLOSED: [2011-11-05 Sat 17:38]
*** DONE Research supporting 2&3 with the same module
    CLOSED: [2011-11-04 Fri 02:32]
    Does setuptools or distutils have some mechanism to automate 2to3 in a
    module installation or something?
*** DONE Add keyword-only arguments support
    CLOSED: [2011-11-05 Sat 23:55]
** Other Python implementations
*** TODO Test in IronPython
*** DONE Test in PyPy

* Partial application decorator
** DONE Look into preserving more function metadata
   CLOSED: [2011-11-05 Sat 17:18]
   Investigate how the @decorator decorator preserves original function
   metadata so that e.g. inspect.getargspec() still returns the original
   result.
** DONE Review __get__ descriptor method
   CLOSED: [2011-11-04 Fri 02:31]
   Is it really necessary to handle instance vs. class and static methods
   separately?  Why did we decide on this approach in the first place?  Why
   does __call__ work here?
* Composition mechanism
** DONE Figure out argspecs for composite functions
   CLOSED: [2011-11-04 Fri 02:16]
   How should we handle argument specifications for composite, partially
   applicable functions?  Should we just attempt to evaluate on the very
   first invocation?
* Unit tests
** DONE Test pointfree on instance, class, static methods 
   CLOSED: [2011-11-05 Sat 01:51]
** DONE Find non-setuptools test execution solution
   CLOSED: [2011-11-05 Sat 01:30]
** TODO Write test for unbound instance, class, static methods
** TODO Look into whether more composite function tests are needed
   Do we need to write more tests for the @pointfree decorator?  What about
   when used with keyword arguments?
** DONE Go over existing unit tests, refactor as necessary
   CLOSED: [2011-11-06 Sun 01:25]
* Documentation
** TODO What's the Pythonic way to present full module documentation?
   Sphinx with reStructuredText?
** TODO Fully specify behavior in inline documentation
** TODO Migrate README.md to reStructuredText
** TODO Add examples to README
** TODO Add Python license info
* Misc
** DONE Convert project back to distutils
   CLOSED: [2011-11-05 Sat 01:30]
** TODO Review distutils project layout
   How is this normally done?

** TODO Figure out what happens to methods of old-style objects
   What happens, exactly, when you try to apply the partial or pointfree
   decorator to a method of an old-style class?
** TODO Examine decorator ordering for class/static pointfree methods
   What happens when you apply @staticmethod or @classmethod above
   @pointfree?
