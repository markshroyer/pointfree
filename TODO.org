* Supporting multiple Python versions
** Python 2
*** DONE Test in Python 2.6
    CLOSED: [2011-11-04 Fri 20:02]
*** DONE Test in Python 2.5
    CLOSED: [2011-11-04 Fri 20:18]
** Python 3
*** TODO Test in Python 3.0
*** TODO Test in Python 3.1
*** TODO Test in Python 3.2
*** DONE Research supporting 2&3 with the same module
    CLOSED: [2011-11-04 Fri 02:32]
    Does setuptools or distutils have some mechanism to automate 2to3 in a
    module installation or something?
* Partial application decorator
** TODO Look into preserving more function metadata
   Investigate how the @decorator decorator preserves original function
   metadata so that e.g. inspect.getargspec() still returns the original
   result.
** DONE Review __get__ descriptor method
   CLOSED: [2011-11-04 Fri 02:31]
   Is it really necessary to handle instance vs. class and static methods
   separately?  Why did we decide on this approach in the first place?  Why
   does __call__ work here?
* Composition mechanism
** DONE Figure out argspecs for composite functions
   CLOSED: [2011-11-04 Fri 02:16]
   How should we handle argument specifications for composite, partially
   applicable functions?  Should we just attempt to evaluate on the very
   first invocation?
* Unit tests
** TODO Test pointfree on instance, class, static methods 
** TODO Find non-setuptools test execution solution
* Documentation
** TODO What's the Pythonic way to present full module documentation?
   Sphinx with reStructuredText?
** TODO Fully specify behavior in inline documentation
** TODO Migrate README.md to reStructuredText
** TODO Add examples to README
